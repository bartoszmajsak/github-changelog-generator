== Labels

Pull Requests will be grouped by labels defined for them. There are two special labels which are handled differently:

 * `skip-changelog` if present on the PR, it will not be included in the list
 * `dependencies`, if PR is titled `"build(deps): bump lib from X to Y"` will only include the latest update in case of many since last release


== Installation

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL http://git.io/install-ghc | bash
----

TIP: You can also specify the version and directory before downloading `curl -sL http://git.io/install-ghc | bash -s -- --version=v0.0.1 --dir=~/bin`
